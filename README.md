# RedditAIBotBuster
Reddit AI BotBuster is a userscript that spots potential bots and AI posts on Reddit. It scans as you browse, highlighting suspicious content with color-coded outlines and shows a popup with usernames and snippets.

## Description

Reddit AI BotBuster is a userscript that highlights potential bot and AI-generated posts on Reddit. It uses advanced heuristics to detect suspicious content and marks them with color-coded outlines so you can easily spot anomalies in your feed.

## Installation Guide

1. **Install Tampermonkey:**  
   Add the Tampermonkey extension to your browser (available for Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

2. **Create a New Script:**  
   Click the Tampermonkey icon and choose "Create a new script".

3. **Paste the Code:**  
   Delete any sample code in the editor and paste the script from this repository.

4. **Save and Enable:**  
   Save the script and ensure it's enabled in Tampermonkey.

5. **Reload Reddit:**  
   Visit or reload a Reddit page. The script will scan your feed and highlight posts/comments that look suspicious.

## How It Works

- **Red Outline:** Bot-like content  
- **Blue Outline:** AI-generated content  
- **Purple Outline:** Both Bot and AI signals detected  
- A popup in the top-right displays a live count and details of flagged content.
